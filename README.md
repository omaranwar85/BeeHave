# BeeHave

This repository contains the board and schematic files (designed in Eagle) for the beehive monitoring system. It also contains a python file 'Script.py' and a numpy file containing the dataset with 1,250 days of beehive sensor data. The sample python script reads the numpy file and uses random forest to estimate the daily weight variations.

As this project progresses, we will be adding more to this repository.
